Abstract

Privacy issue is a main concern in developing face recognition techniques. Al-
though synthetic face images can partially mitigate potential legal risks while
maintaining effective face recognition (FR) performance, FR models trained by
face images synthesized by existing generative approaches frequently suffer from
performance degradation problems due to the insufficient discriminative quality
of these synthesized samples. In this paper, we systematically investigate what
contributes to solid face recognition model training, and reveal that face images
with certain degree of similarities to their identity centers show great effective-
ness in the performance of trained FR models. Inspired by this, we propose a
novel diffusion-based approach (namely Center-based Semi-hard Synthetic Face
Generation (CemiFace)) which produces facial samples with various levels of
similarity to the subject center, thus allowing to generate face datasets containing
effective discriminative samples for training face recognition. Experimental results
show that with a modest degree of similarity, training on the generated dataset can
produce competitive performance compared to previous generation methods. The

Introduction

Face Recognition (FR) has gained significant achievement in recent years owing to the combination of
discriminative loss function [1–5], proprietary backbones [6–11] and large-scale face datasets [12–15].
For example, with a 4M training set, existing FR models can achieve over 99% accuracy on various
academic datasets [3, 6, 2, 16]. However, in real-world industrial face recognition applications,
collecting large-scale face datasets is not always available due to the related licence agreements,
ethical issues and privacy policies [17].

To expand limited training samples in real-world scenarios, generative models [18–23] are widely
adopted owing to their ability to generate high-quality images. However, simply adopting face images
produced by those generic generative models to train face recognition models is impractical as there
is ambiguity about the identities of the produced images because they are derived from random
noises, i.e., the identities of these generated face images cannot be obtained without a well-trained
FR model [24]. To address such issues, synthetic face dataset generation-based solutions [24–28]
have been found to gain benefits in developing effective face recognition models. Existing synthetic
face recognition (SFR) methods are frequently built upon recent advances of generative models

such as Style-GAN [25, 27], Diffusion methods [24, 27] and 3DMM rendering [26]. For instance, a
style-transferring diffusion model-based method namely DCface [24] is proposed, which increases
the diversity of existing face recognition datasets by generating additional discriminative face images
with different styles (e.g. hair, overall lighting, which can be observed in visualization Section 4.3.2)
for each subject. However, domain gap issues exists as the model is trained with paired face images
belonging to the same identity, while those paired images are not available at the inference stage. It
can only take samples belonging to different identities at the inference stage, which may negatively
impact on the images synthesized at the inference stage. Furthermore, the definition of discriminative
facial images remains unclear in this study.

To address the problems outlined above, firstly
we explore the factors resulting in performance
degradation for SFR and reveal that previous
approaches fail to consider the properties of ef-
fective FR training–relationship/similarity be-
tween samples. Consequently, considering the
facts: (a) semi-hard negative samples are cru-
cial to train effective face recognition model
for Triplet loss [29]; (b) samples close to the
decision boundary contribute most to the train-
ing gradient [3]; (c) all face images belonging
to the same subject can be represented by a
hypersphere in the latent feature space [30]
(i.e., can be measured by existing FR models,
e.g., AdaFace [3]), whose distances (radius) to
the identity center are negatively correlated to
their similarities to the center. We hypothesize
that face recognition performance is sensitive
to the data with different levels of similarity
to the identity center in the hypersphere, and
experimentally reveal that the optimal perfor-
mance is obtained with samples of mid-level
similarity, which we term center-based semi-
hard samples. Inspired by this crucial finding,
we propose a novel diffusion-based synthetic
face recognition approach (CemiFace) which generates center-based semi-hard face samples by
regulating the similarity between the generated image and the inquiry image, through a similarity
controlling factor condition. Figure 1 presents the overall hypothesis by showcasing samples with
various similarities to the identity center. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to illustrate the
effectiveness of our proposed CemiFace. Our method achieves promising performance in synthetic
face recognition (SFR). The main contributions and novelties of this work are summarized as follows:

Figure 1: Visualization of the samples with different
similarities. Given an inquiry image, it can form a
hypersphere based on similarity to the inquiry im-
age, where samples with the same similarity share
the same radius. Samples with similarities between
0 to 1 with an interval of 0.33 are shown. With
our proposed CemiFace, each inquiry image finally
forms a novel subject.

• We provide the first comprehensive analysis to illustrate how FR model performance is
affected by different levels of similarity of samples, particularly center-based semi-hard
samples.

• We propose a novel diffusion-based model CemiFace that can generate face images with
various levels of similarity to the identity center, which can be further applied to generate
infinite center-based semi-hard face images for SFR.

• We demonstrate our method can be extended to use as much as the data without label

supervision for training which is an advantage over the previous method [24].

• Experiments show that our CemiFace surpasses other SFR methods with a large margin,

reducing the GAP-to-Real error by half.

2 Related Works and Preliminary

Synthetic Face Generation for FR: With the emergency of generative models, synthesizing fa-
cial data for various facial tasks has become a critical issue, such as applications in Face Anti-
sproofing [31] and Face Recognition [25, 26, 24, 28, 32, 33]. SynFace [25] aims to mix the real

facial images to construct the dataset. DCFace [24] takes diffusion models to adapt style from the
style bank to the identity image and result in discriminative samples with diverse styles. IDiff-
Face [28] proposes the condition latent diffusion models [23] to the feature embedding and images
are synthesized by pretrained decoder.

Preliminary-DDPM: Diffusion models [21, 22] are generative models which denoise an image from
a random noise image. The training pipeline for diffusion models consists of a forward process
wherein noise is progressively added to a given image and a denoising process to predict the estimated
noise for effective denoising. A single forward process is formulated as Markov Gaussian diffusion
with timestep t:

q(xt|xt−1) = N (xt; (cid:112)1 − βtxt−1, βtI)
(1)
Where N () is adding noise function. When accumulating the time step over 0 − T, the final process
is given as follows:

q(x1:T|x0) =

T
(cid:89)

t=1

q(xt|xt−1)

(2)

Then the denoising process is conducted to predict the noise for the time step t using a model σθ (
typically a UNet [34]), the training loss is:

LMSE = Et,x0,ϵ[||σθ(

where βt is the pre-set forward process variances. Then notation ¯αt is given as: ¯αt = (cid:81)t
αt = 1 − βt. ϵ is a random Gaussian noise image ϵ ∼ N (0, 1).

3 The proposed approach

In Section 3.1, we first investigate the relationship between sample similarity and their effectiveness
in training FR models, presenting the finding that samples with certain similarities (i.e., center-based
semi-hard samples) to their identity centers are more effective for training FR models on a real dataset
and subsequently devise a toy experiment to validate it. Inspired by our findings, in Section 3.2
we propose a novel CemiFace, a conditional diffusion model that produces images with various
levels of similarity to an inquiry image. Specifically, Section 3.2.1 introduces how we construct
the similarity condition which is fed to diffusion model to guide the generation, and discusses the
LSimM at to require the generated sample to exhibit a certain similarity degree to the inquiry image.
In Section 3.2.2, we then present how to use our diffusion model to generate a synthetic face dataset
given a fixed similarity condition m and a set of inquiry images.

3.1 The Relationship between Samples Similarity and Performance Degradation

Performance Degradation for Synthetic Face Recognition: Face recognition models trained on face
images synthesised by existing generative models (e.g., style-transfering [24], 3DMM rendering [26]
and latent diffusion expansion [28]) frequently suffer from performance degradation [24–26]. For
example, with the same data volume, the model trained on the state-of-the-art synthetic dataset
DCface [24] produces 11.23% lower verification performance on CFP-FP testset than the model with
the same architecture trained on the real dataset. A key reason for this issue is that these generative
models only intuitively explore the properties of discriminative samples, but fail to consider the
similarity levels among synthesized face images. However, previous studies [29, 2, 3] empirically
reveal that training effective FR models intrinsically relies on semi-hard negative samples in Triplet
Loss [29] or samples close to the decision boundary [2, 3, 35].

Hypothesis and Findings: Since face images belonging to the same identity/class can be aggregated
within a hypersphere [30], where the location of each face image is decided by its similarity to the
identity center (the center of the hypersphere) (illustrated in Fig. 1). We treat all face images of
each subject as an N-1 (N=512 in AdaFace [3]) dimensional sphere with its center representing the
subject-level identity center. Then, the spheres of all subjects can be combined in an N-dimensional
sphere, where each subject-level sphere is a cluster.

Based on this, we hypothesize that samples of mid-level similarities to the identities center play a
dominant impact on the FR performance, as they exhibit discriminative style variations (e.g. age,

pose). To validate the hypothesis, we conduct the first comprehensive investigation for the impact
of different levels of similarity to the identity center on the FR performance. We first split face
images in the CASIA-WebFace [36] into various levels of groups according to their similarities
to their corresponding subject-level identity centers. Here, the identity center of each subject is
obtained by the weight of the linear classification layer, trained using AdaFace [3]. To avoid the
impacts caused by different numbers of training samples, we assign around 100k face images to
each group representing close similarities to their identity centers. This results in 5 distinct similarity
groups. Table 1 reports the performance of model trained on each group and test on five standard face
recognition evaluation datasets [37–41]. Table 9 in Supplementary material Section B.4 displays the
similarity range of each group. We further validate the style variation in Visualization Sec 4.3.2. We
also visualize randomly selected samples of each group in Figure 2. Results reveal that groups with
middle-level similarities (0.76 and 0.70) produced similar but top-performing average accuracy. This
indicates that face images of a certain low similarity to their identity centers (which we refer to
as center-based semi-hard samples) are essential for learning highly accurate face recognition
models. In contrast, the group whose images have the lowest similarity (i.e., 0.53) to their identity
centers obtained the worst performance, which suggests that it is difficult to train an effective face
recognition model with the most challenging samples (i.e., the samples are normally hard to be
distinguished by human observation).

3.2 Center-based Semi-hard Face Image Generator

Inspired by the above findings, this section proposes a novel conditional diffusion model, namely
CemiFace, for synthesising effective center-based semi-hard face images given the inquiry image
(identity center) x and a pre-defined similarity controlling factor m, based on which a new discrimi-
native synthetic dataset is obtained to train effective face recognition models.

Methodology overview: As illustrated in the left side of Fig 3, the training process starts with
adding a noise ϵ ∼ N (0, 1) with timestep t to the clean input image x, resulting in xt. Meanwhile,
similarity conditions m and identity condition Eid(x) are fed to the diffusion model by cross-
attention as illustrated in the lower right part of Fig. 3. Consequently, the diffusion Unet σθ outputs
the estimated noise ϵ′ = σθ(xt, t, m, Eid(x)) for denoising the image as a clean estimated image
ˆx0. Based on the obtained estimated image ˆx0, original x and condition Catt, the whole model is
optimized by the combination of LM SE and LSimM at, defined in the following Section 3.2.1 as well
as the details of constructing condition.

At the inference stage (the upper right part of Fig. 3), random noise xt = xT = ϵ ∼ N (0, 1) and the
time step t = T are first fed to a CD block. This results in an estimated noise ϵ′ = σθ(xt, t, Catt).
Then, a denoise step is adopted to generate xt−1 from xt for efficient interface speed. This process is
repeatedly conducted on the obtained denoised latent images (xt−1, xt−2, · · · , x0) until t = 0, where
x0 is treated as the final generated face image. Here, we assign the same identity label as x to all face
images generated from the inquiry image x. To ensure high inter-class variation, our inquiry images
are filtered by a pretrained FR ( IR-101 trained on the WebFace4M [12] dataset by AdaFace.), which
enforces the similarity between each pair of query images is lower than 0.3. The number of identities
is fully decided by the number of inquiry face images. The pseudo-code for training and generation
are given in Supplementary Material Section A.3.

images with various levels of similarity. Firstly noise is added to the clean facial image before it is
processed by the diffusion model. Then similarity controlling condition m ranging between [-1,1]
with facial embedding is injected to guide the generation. Consequently, the model outputs the
estimated noise, which is adopted to calculate the estimated image. We add similarity matching loss
LSimMat between the estimated image and the input image. For generation, we gradually denoise a
noising image with time step scaling from T to 0, conditions for identity and similarity are left fixed.
The two diffusion models in the generation part mean the same diffusion model at two different time
steps. The right bottom part is the details of using cross-attention to inject similarity condition and
facial embedding into the diffusion models

3.2.1 Training CemiFace

To facilitate our diffusion-based CemiFace can generate diverse center-based semi-hard face images,
we propose a novel diffusion model training strategy. During training, a random Gaussian noise
image ϵ ∼ N (0, 1) is firstly added to a clean face image x at the time step t, before feeding it to the
diffusion model to generate the noise face image xt:
¯αtx0 +
(4)
Then, conditions are constructed based on the similarity controlling factor m, the identity condition
Cid and time step t condition. Subsequently, the diffusion model outputs the estimated noise
ϵ′ = σθ(xt, t, Eid, m) for denoising the image.
Constructing Similarity Controlling Condition: To address the purposes of generating images
at different scales of similarities, two conditions are injected into the diffusion process to guide the
generation process. The first one is the identity condition Cid aiming to anchor the center of the
generated facial images which can be formulated as:

1 − ¯αtϵ

xt =

√

√

Cid = Eid(x)
(5)
where Eid is a pre-trained face recognition model (e.g., IResnet-50 pretrained from AdaFace [3]).
Cid represents the feature embedding of the given image x. Then the most important part is
similarity controlling condition Csim which maps the scalar similarity m into feature embedding.
This condition serves to regulate the similarity to the inquiry image, facilitating the generation of
images spanning from the most challenging samples (m=-1) to the most similar ones (m=1).

Csim = F1(m)
(6)
Where Fi() is the linear projection layer. Then following DCFace [24] the two conditions are
combined and projected as cross-attention conditions for sending to the DDPM process. AdaGN [42]
is adopted to embed time step condition t. cat() is the concatenation operation.

Catt = F2(cat(Cid, Csim))

CA(Q, K, V, Kc, Vc) = Sof tM ax(

(8)

where Catt is treated as the key Kc and value Vc (same as DCFace) to influence the generated face
images. Q = K = V are the query, key and value, representing the latent feature of UNet σθ.

Training Loss: To ensure the similarity between the generated face x0 and the corresponding inquiry
image (identity center) x adheres to the specified similarity factor m as given in the following
equation:

m = sim(Eid(x), Eid(x0))

(9)

where sim() denotes a similarity measurement (e.g., can be computed by Cosine Similarity or
Euclidean Distance). Following DDPM [24, 21], an approximated clean sample x0 can be traced
from xt at the time step t through the following formula:

x0 ≈ ˆx0 = (xt −

1 − ¯αtϵ′)/

¯αt

(10)

√

√

This gives a hint that the generated face image x0 can be controlled at the training phase by
regularizing the estimated ˆx0, which allows the gradient to be back-propagated to the diffusion
model, e.g., controlling facial attributes [43] and styles [24]. Inspired by this, we propose a novel
similarity Matching loss LSimMat aimed at disentangling the generated face image x0 to exhibit a
certain similarity to the inquiry image, which is determined by the similarity controlling factor m.
We employ the Time-step Dependent loss [24] with different time step t at Eq 13, specifically firstly
an identity loss for recovering the identity of the original inquiry image x, which will be applied to
produce original facial embedding when the time step t → 0:

Lrec = ||1 − sim(Eid(x), Eid(ˆx0))||2
(11)
Then, we require the estimated ˆx0 to produce an feature embedding Eid(ˆx0) which matches the
original x with m similarity as:

Lsim = ||m − sim(Eid(x), Eid(ˆx0)||2

(12)

Consequently, the overall identity regularization loss at the time step t can be formulated as:

LSimMat = (1 − γt)Lrec + γtLsim

(13)
where γt = t
T is the scaling weight for adjusting the similarity of the generated ˆx0. At the time
step t=0, the model outputs an image with the same identity as the original image x. When t scales
from 0 to the maximum time step T, the generated face image gradually shifts far away from the
x. When approaching T, the model will output the image with m similarity to the original image.
The proposed LSimMat loss is inspired by the fact that facial images, with diverse styles but the
same degree of similarity, are located at a circle of the hypersphere. This loss can regularize the
model to learn this kind of pattern. Specifically, the similarity is guaranteed by our proposed loss,
and the diversity is facilitated by the random noise ϵ of the diffusion models, which is validated in the
Visualization Sec. 4.3.2. The overall training object is:

L = LMSE + λLSimMat
where λ is a hyperparameter for balance the training focuses on noise estimation or identity-related
similarity regularization.

(14)

3.2.2 Face Image Generation with Appropriate Similarity

Given a random noise ϵ and conditions(i.e. identity, similarity and time step), the well-trained model
progressively denoises the noisy image ϵ with a varying time step t (from the maximum T to 0) and
a fixed similarity factor condition m to generate a clean image with a specified similarity m to the
given inquiry image x, we adopt DDIM [22] for efficient interface speed.

We experimentally investigate the appropriate generation similarity m for synthetic face recognition.
Specifically, we first adopt fixed similarity factors to test the best similarity. We also explore mixing
the similarity around the appropriate fixed m (mixing semi-hard m) and mixing appropriate fixed m
samples with easy samples (mixing easy m).

Implementation Details

Evaluation Metrics: We examine the 1:1 verification accuracy trained on the dataset generated
by our CemiFace on various famous testsets including LFW [37], CFP-FP [38], AgeDB-30 [39],
CPLFW [40], CALFW [41] and their average verification accuracy AVG. Gap-to-Real is the gap to
the results trained on CASIA-WebFace with CosFace loss.

Details of CemiFace Training and Generation: The condition m is appropriately adjusted during
the training phase to facilitate better generalization across various similarities. Considering the overall
cosine similarity ranges from -1 to 1, the model is enabled to discern differences in generated images
under varying similarity controlling conditions when training. Specifically, in the mini-batch, we
assign a randomly selected m from -1 to 1 with an interval of 0.02, allowing the model to generate
corresponding images at different similarity scales. The synthetic face recognition datasets are
generated in 3 volumes. Specifically in 0.5M data volume, we generate 50 images per subject and a
total of 10k subjects; As for 1.0M, we keep 50 images per subject but with 20k subjects; For 1.2M,
we add 5 images per subject with 40k subjects to the 1.0M settings. Oversampling method as used in
DCFace is adopted which adds 5 repeated inquiry images to each subject. For more details including
model, ablation studies and discussions please refer to Supplementary material A.1, B and C

Details of Training the Synthetic Dataset
As the training code of DCFace [24] and
DigiFace [26] for training the SFR is not re-
leased. We opt for CosFace [1] with some
regularizations to match the performance of
DCFace [24]. Specifically, the margin of
Cosface is 0.4, weight decay is 5e-4, learn-
ing rate is 1e-1 and is decayed by 10 at the
26th and 34th epoch, totally the model is
trained for 40 epochs. We add random re-
size & crop with the scale of [0.9, 1.0], Ran-
dom Erasing with the scale of [0.02,0.1], and
random flip. Brightness, contrast, saturation
and hue are all set to be 0.1. The backbone
opted for is IR-SE50 [2]

performance on each evaluation dataset. The right
figure is the average accuracy of our CemiFace

Appropriate m for Generation: Herein we
ablate how a scalar m influences the genera-
tion in terms of training performance. We adopt different m ranging from -1 to 1 with the interval of
0.1 to generate face groups of 10k identities with 10 samples per identity to match the data volume
in the finding for CASIA-WebFace in Sec. 3.1. Figure 4 illustrates the accuracy curves when using
those data for training face recognition (for detailed numerical results please refer to Supplementary
Material B.4.2). Similarity m=0 provides the best recognition performance 89.567 in terms of the
AVG, then m=0.1 has the AVG of 89.368, with m=-0.1 obtains 87.708. It can be concluded the appro-
priate degree of similarity for generating discriminative samples is around 0 to 0.1, which is different
from the similarity of CASIA-WebFace where the best recognition performance is obtained with the
similarity of 0.7. This may be because the model for comparing similarity on CASIA-WebFace is
pretrained on this dataset.

Generation with Mixing m: We conduct the experiment of including mixed m when generating the
dataset, as is shown in the top part of Tab 2 and Tab 3. Specifically, we opt for mixing the generation
m from -0.1 to 0.1, and from 0 to 0.1. We use training m varying from [0,1], and the generation
interval is 0.02. The results show that mixing m with 0 to 0.1 when generating the data will bring
worse performance compared to single m=0. However, mixing m with -0.1 to 0.1 obtains a similar
performance compared to m=0. Additionally, progressively mixing m with easy and semi-hard

samples are provided in Tab 3, as observed, with more easy samples included in the training dataset,
the FR performance reduced more prominent. We keep the generation m to be 0 for later discussion.

Training with Various m: The choice of various levels of m during the training stage are ablated in
the bottom part of Table 2 where 3 settings are considered when training CemiFace:(a) single m with
similarity of 0; (b) multiple discrete m ranging from 0 to 1 with 50 steps; (c) similar to (b) but with a
range of [-1,1] and interval 0.04. Then we synthesize the data with m=0. As observed, setting (c)
yields the best performance, indicating that with a broad range of similarity across -1 to 1, covering
all the available probabilities, the CemiFace model can generalize well when adapted for generating
highly discriminative samples. We also include experiments of changing the interval for (c) setting
from 0.02 to 0.06 at the bottom of Tab 2, the result suggests that our approach is robust to the discrete
interval but sensitive to the range of training m. We do not consider continuous similarity as the
trained model collapses to generate the same image when given different similarities m.

4.2.2 Ablation Study for Training and Inquiry Data

Impact of Training Data: Since our method does not require paired images for training the diffusion
model, the limitation of using unlabelled data is alleviated. Consequently, we conduct experiments to
see the impact of different training data. Specifically, we employ 3 datasets for training:(a) CASIA-
WebFace as used in DCFace; (b) A challenging in-the-wild dataset Flickr with 1.2M images collected
by us from Flickr website; (c) VGGFace2 [13] which is a large-scale dataset containing 3.3M clean
images. Training m is set to vary within the range of [-1,1] while generation m is kept as 0. We do
not consider data from FFHQ [18] due to restrictions on being applied for face recognition.

We can see from Table 4 using VGGFace2 as the training set produces the best performance when
training a model on it, indicating that training on a large-scale dataset will bring more advance in
generating discriminative dataset. However, to conduct a fair comparison with previous methods, we
adopt CASIA-WebFace for the following studies. Additionally, although Flickr contains much more
challenging conditions such as blurred, cartoon, and occluded faces, it results in similar performance
compared to DCFace [24], which proves the effectiveness of our proposed CemiFace.

Impact of the Inquiry Data: The choice of appropriate inquiry image x which can be referred
to as an initial point, is essential because we regard the generated group from the given x to be an

8

independent identity group. DCFace employs a pre-trained DDPM model [21] trained on FFHQ to
generate synthetic facial images. The style bank is sampled from a real-world dataset, e.g. CASIA-
WebFace [36]. Their process involves a combination of synthetic facial data and a real dataset. In
contrast to DCFace, our method has fewer constraints when referring to the source data. The source
data can be either synthetic or real, and we ablate the impact of using synthetic data and real data.

For taking synthetic data as the inquiry samples, we use the samples from DCface to conduct a
fair comparison, noted as DDPM. As for adopting real-data, we consider two options: (a) 1-shot
data randomly sampled from WebFace-4m [12] which provides a clean dataset. (b) 1-shot Flickr,
a challenging dataset filtered from the one collected in Sec. 4.2.2, with fewer licence restriction.
If inquiry images with high similarity, they result in overlapped groups of synthetic images in
hypersphere space. Therefore, we follow DCface to filter out samples with a similarity higher than
0.3. We ablate the choice of the inquiry data source in Table 4, observing from changing the inquiry
data, using 1-shot data of WebFace4M performs slightly better for our CemiFace. However, applying
1-shot WebFace4M to DCFace leads to a performance drop, as there are constraints for DCFace
training and generation, e.g. frontal face and no glasses. Then using the challenging 1-shot Flickr
as inquiry data brings worse results. This indicates that clean and real inquiry images are beneficial
to generate discriminative datasets. Additionally, appropriate m for each inquiry dataset with 0.5M
volume is also around 0 which can be observed in Tab 5.

4.3 Comparison with the State-of-Art methods

4.3.1 Quantitative Results:

We compare our CemiFace with the previous methods to demonstrate its effectiveness. The models
compared are SynFace [25], DigiFace [26], IDiff-Face [28] and DCFace [24] in both 0.5M, 1M
and 1.2M image volumes. The loss for training the synthetic dataset is CosFace. For the CemiFace
training set, we choose CASIA-WebFace to have a fair comparison with DCFace, training m ranges
from -1 to 1 with 50 discrete steps, and generation m is 0. The results are available in Table 6. In
0.5 M protocol, our method exceeds the previous state-of-art method DCface in terms of all the
evaluation datasets where we achieve significant improvement on pose-sensitive dataset CFP-FP and
CPLFW by 3.36 and 4.39 respectively. And in the average protocol, we get 92.30 while DCFace is
90.18. Our method still cannot exceed the model trained on the real dataset CASIA-WebFace, but
we reduce the GAP-to-Real error from 4.08 to 1.96 ( 4.08−1.96
4.08 = 51.96% relative error) compared
to DCFace. When it refers to the 1.0M and 1.2M settings, a similar phenomenon can be observed,
our method surpasses DCFace on all protocols which reduces the Gap-to-Real by half, i.e. 1.59
and 1.36. In general, CemiFace behaves well on all verification accuracy and improves pose-related
performance by a large margin.

4.3.2 Qualitative Results

We visualize the generated results to compare with DCFace in Figure 5. Specifically, samples with
different m scaling between [-1,1] with interval 0.2 are presented. For each row, we opt for the same
noise to illustrate the variations across different similarities. We observe that when m is set to 1, the
identity of the generated sample is very close to the inquiry image. When m is 0.4, gender and age
change can be observed from the last two rows. With m scaling far away from the inquiry image,
pose changes can be noticed for the first 3 rows. Another interesting phenomenon appears when
similarity is -1.0 where the generated samples change significantly. Additionally, when the noise
changes, the generated images exhibit different styles, aligning with our hypothesis in Sec. 3.2.1.
Finally, with m=0, the group looks extremely different to the inquiry image, but can deliver highly
accurate face recognition performance.

Figure 5: Sample Visualization under different similarity. From left to right are inquiry images,
images with m from 1 to -1 and samples generated by DCFace. Different rows in each inquiry group
represent the results produced by different noises. The first column are the inquiry images. The
yellow dashed box includes samples where we obtain the best accuracy. Pink dashed boxes are
samples that vary vastly.

5 Conclusion

This paper proposes a novel method to generate a discriminative dataset for training effective face
recognition models with reduced privacy concerns. We investigate the factors contributing to the
effective face recognition model training and re-formulate the challenge of generating discriminative
samples as synthesizing center-based semi-hard samples. A similarity controlling factor condition is
adopted for generating semi-hard samples. Models trained on the generated dataset with center-based
semi-hard samples produce accurate face recognition performance over the previous methods. A
notable advantage of CemiFace is its independence from a labelled dataset for training. However,
the limitations of CemiFace include relying on the pretrained identity network’s performance for
conducting similarity comparisons, being sensitive to the quality of the inquiry image and privacy
issues arising as the pretrained model derives from a dataset without user consent.

This is the supplementary material for the paper CemiFace: Center-based Semi-hard Synthetic
Face Generation for Face Recognition.

A Addition to: Implementation details

A.1 Diffusion Details

We follow most of the settings of DCFace [24]. Specifically, the model is trained on CASIA-
WebFace [14] with 10 epochs. The maximum time step T for diffusion training is 1000. Then for
generating the synthetic face recognition dataset, the time step for DDIM [22] is 20. The optimizer
opted for is AdamW [44]. The batch size is 160 on 2 A100 GPUs. CemiFace training takes 8 hours,
the generation also takes 8 hours. As a comparison, DCFace takes 10 hours for Training and 9 hours
for Generation. Both DCFace and our method need around 6-7 hours to conduct FR training.

As for the diffusion UNet, we remove the identity feature in Residual Block, for more details of the
Diffusion UNet please refer to DCFace [24].

A.2 High Inter-class Variations and High Intra-class Variations

(1) High Inter-class Variations: Each inquiry face image is selected to be highly independent on
other inquiry images. Specifically, we follow DCFace to use a pre-trained FR model to keep samples
with a threshold of lower 0.3.

(2) High Intra-class Variations: high intra-class variations are ensured by (a) changing the similarity
condition m, as a small input similarity m results in the generated semi-hard images belonging to
the same identity having long distances to the identity center; and (b) the face images of the same
identity generated by CemiFace are distributed in all directions from the identity center, which can
be observed from supplementary material T-SNE Fig. 7. This is guaranteed by randomly sampled
Gaussian noises ϵ input to the diffusion model, which exhibits a large variation. As a result, both
properties would ensure the generated face images of the same identity are almost evenly distributed
in a sphere that has a relatively large radius, and thus they would have high intra-class variations.

A.3 Pseudo-code

A.4 Dataset statistics

We have also calculated the number of face images belonging to different similarity groups for
CemiFace and DCFace in the Tab 7, indicating that our CemiFace tends to generate images showing
lower similarities to their identity centers (i.e. all samples are semi-hard), while DCFace containing
more easy samples.

B Further Experiments

B.1 Impact of Identity Center and Random Center

The performance of CemiFace is highly affected by the characteristics of the inquiry samples. Herein
we examine how the model behaves when subjected to numerical identity conditions. Two kinds of
centers are considered:(a) identity centers derived from the CASIA-WebFace dataset, and (b) random
centers with a similarity range of [-0.1, 0.2] to (a). By observing from the Table 8, with random
center the model results in invalid results; On the other hand, when utilizing identity centers, the
model performs optimally when the similarity controlling condition m is set to 0 which aligns our
previous finding. However, it is noteworthy that with identity center the performance is worse than
the dataset inquired by 1-shot WebFace, exhibiting similar results to DCFace.

To provide deeper insights into this phenomenon, we visualize the samples generated by different
inquiry centers in Figure 6. Notably, with m=1 the random center produces images with different
identities which can simply be concluded by human observation. Conversely with the identity center,
given a similarity of 1.0, the generated samples appear highly similar, except for the samples circled in
red. Further investigation reveals that the number of images in that subject comprises approximately
16 images while the left subject provides approximately 50 images. Intuitively, A model trained
on this dataset will focus more on the subjects with a large number of images which explains the
suboptimal results obtained by identity center.

Figure 6: Comparison of different inquiry center. From top to bottom are images inquired by Random
Center, CASIA Identity Center and 1-shot Real images. For Identity Center and 1-shot Real images,
images similarity of 1 and 0 are shown. Different columns represent given different noise. Two
examples are shown for each case. The inquiry images in the identity center are selected from the
dataset. The red circles contain samples that look extreme different from the inquiry center.

We further visualize the T-SNE of the feature embedding in Figure 7. As shown in the upper figure,
with higher similarity, the samples tend to cluster in the central region. Subsequently, by inspecting
the bottom figure, it becomes apparent that with a similarity of 1.0, each subject is located in a
different specific area. Consequently, a similarity of -1.0 results in each image being positioned close
to other subjects in the middle area.

B.2 Addition to the Inquiry Data: Image Quality

The above discussion validates how CemiFace is affected by different centers in the aspect of
numerical results. For a better understanding of the negative impact brought by challenge inquiry
data such as 1-shot Flickr, we visualize the images generated from different image quality in Figure 8.
Specifically, we present inquiry images subjected to blur, occlusion, extreme pose, painted and clear
conditions, with a similarity controlling condition m set to 0. By comparing the last block with the
rest of the blocks, one can conclude that extreme image quality fails to generate clean images. In
conclusion, unblurred, non-occluded, appropriately posed, and real-world data are essential for our
model to generate a highly clean synthetic face recognition dataset.

B.3 Further Ablation Studies

B.3.1

Impact of Different Pretrained loss

As DCFace hasn’t released its AdaFace-based SFR training code and details, we were not able to
reproduce it for our model training. Thus, in Tab 6 fairly compare ours with DCFace by adopting
the same pre-trained AdaFace model to train our diffusion generator, and then employing the same
CosFace loss for both ours and DCFace’s SFR models training. Results show that our CemiFace still
outperformed the SOTA DCFace. Additionally, we provide results achieved by using pre-trained
model trained by CosFace. Specifically, we apply a model pre-trained by CosFace to train both our
generator, and employ the same CosFace loss for their SFR models’ training. The experiment shows
that the model pretrained from CosFace performs better than that of AdaFace.

Following previous works(DCFace [24], DigiFace [26], SynFace [25]), we use the IResnet-SE-50
modified by ArcFace [2] as the default backbone. Additionally, we provide the results achieved by
IResnet-18(R18), IResnet-SE-50(R50) and IResnet-SE-100(R100) in table 10 for reference.

B.4.3 FID Image Quality

We use Fréchet Inception Distance(FID) which measures the distribution similarity of the given two
datasets. Specifically, in Tab 12, FID is reported by comparing randomly selected 10k samples with
randomly selected CASIA. Need to note that our method doesn’t intend to generate images similar to
the distribution of CASIA-WebFace, but to construct a discriminative dataset that is conducive to
providing highly accurate FR performance

B.4.4 Euclidean Distance

As shown in Tab 13 using Euclidean distance leads to worse performance than cosine similarity,
which might be due to the FR training loss (CosFace [1]) being carried on cosine similarity.

B.4.5

Impact of λ

We present the results using different λ in the left part of the Tab 14. Performance is sensitive to λ,
and large λ results in performance degradation.

C Privacy Concerns

In this section, we are going to discuss the privacy issues that lie in developing synthetic face
generation for face recognition. The primary aim of synthetic face recognition is to mitigate concerns
associated with privacy. Large-scale face recognition data are usually collected from web scrappers
by searching name lists (usually celebrities), without obtaining user consent. Consequently, some of
the large-scale datasets [13, 15] are abandoned by their collector to avoid Legal Risk. In addition,
IDiff-Face [28] mentions European Union (EU) has come up with the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) [17] to regulate the application of facial data, making it harder to use face
recognition data.

We notice that DCFace [24] incorporates a labelled dataset for training style transferring solution, and
when they generate the new dataset, they use samples provided by DDPM [21] trained on FFHQ [18].
However, a noteworthy concern arises as the FFHQ dataset, whose derivative model is used as
pretrained model in DCFace for sample generation, explicitly bans its application in face recognition.
Consequently, we are not sure whether the model and synthetic face images based on FFHQ are
allowed to be used. We try to avoid privacy concerns from the aspect of collecting Flickr which
contains diverse licenses with reduced privacy problems. Another potential solution to avoid privacy
concerns is to use samples like Digiface [26] which is rendered by 3DMM. However, DigiFace
is only allowed to be adopted for non-commercial applications, but one can render images from
3DMM following the DigiFace pipeline for commercial purposes. We append the result inquired
by 1-shot DigiFace in the bottom part of Table 8 for reference and example images generated by
1-shot DigiFace are shown in Figure 9. Results reveal that 1-shot DigiFace still can not surpass 1-shot
WebFace but still behave better than DCFace. Finally, although 1-shot Digiface samples sometimes
don’t appear to be like real humans, the generated samples exhibit similar patterns to real-world
images from human observation.

Our method CemiFace offers the advantage of not requiring labels during the training phase compared
to DCFace. Nonetheless, both our method and DCFace adopt a pre-trained face recognition model
which may counter legal issues. we hope further researchers bring steps forward to avoid using this
kind of pre-trained face recognition model to alleviate legal concerns in this domain.

D Discussion

D.1 Why Semi-hard samples work

We assume the benefits of the semi-hard training face images could be attributed to:

• easy training samples are typically images where the face is clear, well-lit, and faces the
camera directly, and thus training on such easy samples would not allow the trained FR
models to be able to generalize for face images with large pose/age/expression variations
and different lighting conditions/backgrounds that are frequently happened in real-world
applications. AdaFace [3] also mentioned that easy samples could be beneficial to
early-stage training, while hard sample mining is needed for achieving generalized and
effective FR models;

• Hard samples normally contain noise data. Specifically, FaceNet [29] demonstrates that
the hardest sample mining using a large batch size leads to hard convergence and produces
inferior performance. This is because training with very hard samples may not allow FR
models to learn effective features but focus on cues apart from facial identities;

• Semi-hard samples generated by CemiFace mostly contain large posed faces but fewer
face-unrelated noises. We also evaluate the training epochs needed to reach the highest AVG
performance for easy samples (m = 0.7), semi-hard samples(m = 0) and extreme hard
samples (m = −0.5). Easy samples take 10 epochs to reach the best AVG and 20 epochs to
produce the training loss of 0; Semi-hard samples take much longer (38 epochs) to provide
the highest AVG while the final training loss is around 3; and FR models training on extreme
hard samples could not converge.

different images. Different columns are randomly selected generated samples.

The actual similarity to the inquiry center indicates that our CemiFace tends to generate images
showing lower similarities to their identity centers (i.e. all samples are semi-hard), while DCFace
contains more easy samples.

D.2 Different diffusion Loss

As there are some other variation diffusion losses such as Improved-DDPM [45] which has been
applied in Diffusion Transformer ( DIT) [46], Variational Diffusion Models (VDM)[47]. We follow
the previous SOTA SFR studies (DCFace [24] and IDiffFace [28]) to choose the same generic MSE
diffusion loss [21, 22] as our base model, ensuring the reproducibility of our approach and its fair
comparison with DCFace [24] and IDiffFace [28].

D.3 Difference between Dataset Distillation

Dataset distillation methods [48–50] are widely adopted to create a dataset that can produce high
performance when training a model on it. SRe2L [48] is a recent state-of-the-art method for dataset
distillation which trains the noise image through a pretrained backbone. Their main process contains
a forward process to get the classification label of the trainable noise inquiry image and train the noise
inquiry image to produce a specific class prediction with BN alignment. The distinctions between our
method with theirs are:

• Embedding vs Classification Layer: We aim to explore the feature embedding of the

backbone, not the classification layer.

• Consideration of Image Similarity: Our method explores the similarity of the given inquiry

image, which is not considered in recent dataset distillation methods.

• Pattern Distillation: Their approach focuses on distilling data from existing classes, while
our CemiFace distils patterns from the pretrained face recognition model. This learned
pattern can be applied to unseen subjects, as we utilize independent data that was not part of
the pretrained model’s training dataset.

• Extra Model: We incorporate a diffusion model to introduce parameters for producing

high-quality images.

D.4 Relationship to ID3PM

Recent work, i.e. ID3PM [51] proposes to invert the Black-Box model of face recognition to generate
a similar image to the inquiry image. However, our method differs from theirs in several aspects:

• Purpose: Their objective is to invert the black-box model without full access, whereas we

aim to generate a discriminative dataset.

• Image Similarity: They require the generated image to be like the original image, while

our goal is to ensure the generated images encompass diverse styles.

• Evaluation Approach: They evaluate by replacing the data of the evaluation dataset,

whereas our approach involves training a model on the generated dataset.

• Theoretical Degradation: When m is set to 1, our model theoretically degrades to their

model.

• Diffusion Model Structures: We use different diffusion model structures to conduct experi-
ments, specifically employing cross-attention and AdaGN [42] for inserting conditions.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Contributions of this paper are included in the abstract and introduction

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims

made in the paper.

• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.

• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how

much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.

• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals

are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations

Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have discussed the limitation in the conclusion section

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that

the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.

• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.

• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.

• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.

• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms

and how they scale with dataset size.

• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to

address problems of privacy and fairness.

• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory Assumptions and Proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: [NA]

22

Justification: We only have experimental assumptions and they are proved in the main paper
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-

referenced.

• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.

• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented

by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.

• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental Result Reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We will release the code and data upon acceptance. And we provide detailed
information for reproducing.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.

• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken

to make their results reproducible or verifiable.

• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.

• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example
(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how

to reproduce that algorithm.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe

the architecture clearly and fully.

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).

(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

23

Answer: [No]
Justification: We will release the code and data upon acceptance.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
• Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/

public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.

• While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).

• The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https:
//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.

• The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
• The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.

• At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized

versions (if applicable).

• Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the

paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. Experimental Setting/Details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All experimental details are provided
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail

that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.

• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental

material.

7. Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Our experimental results show that the proposed method exceeds previous
works by a large margin. And we have run the experiments multiple times to confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed method.
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,

call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

• The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

24

• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error

of the mean.

• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.

• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).

• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Computational cost is included in the Supplementary Material

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,

or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.

• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual

experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.

• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

9. Code Of Ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have made sure the anonymity

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a

deviation from the Code of Ethics.

• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-

eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. Broader Impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have discussed the privacy issues brought by Face Recognition.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal

impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.

• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.

• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer:[Yes]

Justification: We avoid using data that is banned from being applied to Face recognition and
discussed the privacy issues.

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.

• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors

should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.

• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

12. Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer:[Yes]

Justification: Our models and code used in the paper are licensed

Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
• The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
• The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a

URL.

• The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
• For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of

service of that source should be provided.

• If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the
package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets
has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

• For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of

the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

26

• If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to

the asset’s creators.

13. New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: No assets
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
• Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.

• The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose

asset is used.

• At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either

create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer:[NA]
Justification: We do not collect data, but generate synthetic data
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with

human subjects.

• Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.

• According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.

15. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human

Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?
Answer: [NA]
Justification: We do not collect data, but generate synthetic data
Guidelines:

• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with

human subjects.

• Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)
may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

• We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.

• For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if

applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
